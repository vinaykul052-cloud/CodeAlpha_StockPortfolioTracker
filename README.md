CodeAlpha Internship Tasks

Welcome to my CodeAlpha Internship repository. This repository contains the Python projects I completed as part of my internship tasks. Each task is implemented in a separate Python file with clear instructions and outputs.

## Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
- *Description:* A simple stock tracker that calculates the total investment based on user input. Users enter stock names and quantities, and the program uses hardcoded stock prices to compute the total value. Optionally, the result can be saved to a .txt file.
- *File:* task2_stock_tracker.py
- *Concepts Used:* Dictionary, Loops, Input/Output, Basic Arithmetic, File Handling (optional)
- *How to Run:*  
  1. Open task2_stock_tracker.py in Python environment.  
  2. Run the code and follow the on-screen instructions to enter stock names and quantities.  
  3. After finishing, the total investment will be displayed and optionally saved to portfolio.txt.
